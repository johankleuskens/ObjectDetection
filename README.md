# ObjectDetection
**Courseras Deep Learning Object Detection Algoritm**.

This is my version of the Object Detection source code from the Deep Learning Coursera course. I changed this a little bit so it \
runs on my local Ubuntu machine without using the Jupyter notebook. 

I have the following versions running:
* Ubuntu: 16.04 LTE
* Python : 3.6.0
* Tensorflow : 1.4.1
* Keras : 2.1.0

I installed Pyhon 3.6.0 as told via this link: https://askubuntu.com/questions/865554/how-do-i-install-python-3-6-using-apt-get
 and then followed the "pyenv" route (#56)
 
After installing python 3.6.0, I installed the following packages via "pip install -upgrade ...":
- jupyter, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scipy scikit-learn
- keras, image, tensorflow, h5py

Please note that I was not able to upoad the yolo.h5 file in the model_data directory as it is too large ( > 100MB). This file contains the trained data for the YOLO network.
