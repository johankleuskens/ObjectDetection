# ObjectDetection
**Courseras Deep Learning Object Detection Algoritm**.

This is my version of the Object Detection source code from the Deep Learning Coursera course. I changed this a little bit so it \
runs on my local Ubuntu machine. 

I have the following versions running:
Ubuntu: 16.04 LTE
Python : 3.6.0
Tensorflow : 1.4.1
Keras : 2.1.0

I installed Pyhon 3.6.0 as told via this link: https://askubuntu.com/questions/865554/how-do-i-install-python-3-6-using-apt-get
 and then followed the "pyenv" route (#56)
 
After installing python 3.6.0, I installed the follwoing packages via "pip install -upgrade ...":
- jupyter, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scipy scikit-learn
- keras, image, tensorflow, h5py
